House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned Stark went to King's landing where he made lots of friends and lived
happily ever after...  He definitely didn't get axe murdered.

And even if he did get murdered, he has the power to come back to life thanks
to the gift of life given by Athena to him.

AND THEN THE DRAGONS CAME AND ATE THE GODS AND THE MEN AND IT WAS GLORIOUS
